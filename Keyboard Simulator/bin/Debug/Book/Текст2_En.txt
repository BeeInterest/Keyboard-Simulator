The Black Forest is a large mountain range located in southwestern Germany. As the name suggests, it's covered by a lush forest. The highest summit1 of the range is the Feldberg mountain (1,493 m above sea level). The region is widely known for its precious minerals as well as its rich history, culture and cooking style. In ancient literature the region is first mentioned in the works of Pliny and Tacitus. Almost for 2000 years, from the 5th century BC up to the 16th century, the Black Forest was known only for its surplus of ore. Workers of the few settlements that were in the region made a living mining lead, silver and iron. An outbreak of plague and the German Peasants' War forced a decline of the region in the 16th century, through and all the way up to the beginning of the 18th century, when the mines were reopened, while lumbering and rafting2 of precious timber solidified its prospects of economic prosperity. The region's relative seclusiveness3 coupled with an access to abundant mineral resources made people who lived in the Black Forest into artisan4 craftsmen. Even before the widespread advent5 of precision mechanics, the people of the Black Forest made additional income making wooden clocks and toys when mines and lumber mills were closed. When the Industrial Revolution dawned and a railway network made its way into the region, its clockmakers, jewelers and glassmakers became prominent throughout Europe. In the 20th and 21st centuries the main industries of the region were power plants and tourism. Many of the mines were remade into museums, which are opened daily for the visitors. Numerous military conflicts of the Late Middle Ages, as well as those of early modern period, have left many archeological sites to discover, many of them pertaining6 to warfare, including more than 200 km of defensive fortifications. New archeological sites are still being discovered these days, and the full inventorying7 is still yet to be completed. Someone who has no interest in history or industry can still find many interesting things to do there. The big lakes Titisee and Schluchsee are surrounded by small resort towns that offer miscellaneous water sport activities including deep diving. Each year the region sees a competition held between amateur and professional confectioners8 who aim to perfect an art of making the famous Black Forest gateau9. Today the region makes use of developed transport infrastructure and is easily accessible from any other region of Germany. A bus ticket from Berlin to Freiburg, one of the largest cities in the region, will cost you approximately 30 euros.Friederike Victoria Gessner (better known by her pen name1 as Joy Adamson) was an Austrian-born writer, painter and naturalist famous for her work raising and reintroducing big cats into the wild. Briefly considering a career of a musician or a doctor at first, in 1937 Friederike was forced to migrate from turbulent2 Vienna into wild Kenya. Being very easy-going by nature, she made friends wherever she went. Soon enough she found herself very close to many researchers, biologists and wildlife conservators who were prominent3 in the area. Thus she spent her younger years as a naturalist, doing sketches and making observations on various flora and fauna. Her greatest work was yet to come, though. When she was 42, her then-husband George Adamson, a senior wildlife warden4, was asked to protect local farmers from a lioness that was threatening them. As it turned out later, the lioness was simply protecting her cubs from encroaching5 human settlement. After successfully fighting the lioness off, George and Friederike decided to adopt those little lions. Tending to all three of them at home has proven very difficult, so the couple eventually donated two larger cubs to Rotterdam Zoo, and took the smallest one, Elsa, for themselves. As the young lioness was growing up very fast, Friederike has realised that soon they wouldn't be able to provide for her, so she decided to teach Elsa how to act on her own, hunt, and live in the wild. Taking this duty very diligently6 and treating Elsa as an equal rather than as a pet, Friederike (who by this point has already adopted her pen name) has managed to succeed. Roughly two years later Elsa, now a wild lioness, brought a litter7 of her own, and those three cubs were the first ever to be born by a domesticated lioness that was reintroduced into the wild. This was an unprecedented story in a naturalist world, and soon enough Joy Adamson had the attention of both scientists and cinematographers. The story of Elsa was documented in her book, Born Free, that was also made into a motion picture in 1966. Encouraged by her first successes, Joy shifted her focus to cheetahs. While still a rather large cat and a very fast predator, a cheetah nevertheless is one of the most vulnerable species amongst its kind. They suffer both from larger and smaller predators, as well as from human encroachment. Using the techniques she learned with Elsa, Joy successfully reintroduced Pippa, a female cheetah, into the wild. Joy has dedicated two books to Pippa and her litter, first being The Spotted Sphinx, and the second being Pippa's Challenge. Yet another success was waiting some years later, when Joy successfully worked on a reintroduction of an African leopard named Penny. In her later years Joy was an activist, travelling around the world, making speeches and raising funds in order to protect the wildlife. Her life ended tragically shortly before her 70th birthday as she was murdered by a disgruntled8 laborer who was fired by Adamson not too long ago. Her ashes were scattered in Meru National Park over Elsa's grave as an eternal testament9 to the fact that we all were born to be free.David Bowie (born David Robert Jones) was an English musician, actor, and one of the most prominent1 artists of the 20th and the early 21th centuries. The American popular culture magazine Rolling Stone placed him as 39th in their list of 'The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time', right behind John Lennon, and, following Bowie's death in 2016, they also called him 'The Greatest Rock Star Ever'. David Bowie was born 1947 in London to a working class family. As a child, he was very gifted, albeit2 with a temper. When he was only 9 years old, he was already noticed by his music teachers for his highly imaginative3 and flashy dancing style. His childhood was spent under heavy influence of popular artists of the time, mainly Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Fats Domino. As a teenager, Bowie took many classes in various musical instruments, including ukulele, piano and saxophone. In his free time, he liked doing impressions4 of his favourite artists to his friends. Later on, when talking about it, his friends and biographers were noting that Bowie's performances were 'like something from another planet'. After multiple unsuccessful tries joining with various local bands, David has tried to embark5 on a solo career. He's taken his alias inspired by James Bowie, an american pioneer who has also invented a bowie knife. This try was not very successful as well. Nevertheless, Bowie persisted relentlessly6, recording his own music, building up his network of contacts in the music world, and educating himself in various theatrical arts. The real fame came to him after his song Space Oddity that was released as a single on July, 11, 1969, a mere few days before the fateful Apollo 11 launch. The song was inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey which was released just a year before that. The single quickly climbed to the top five in the UK charts. The song became one of Bowie's signature songs, while it's hero, Major Tom, eventually became a recurring7 character in his other songs. Building on his newfound8 fame, Bowie again tried to build a team around himself. Fairly antagonistic by nature, he nevertheless managed to record another of his iconic albums, The Man Who Sold the World. Around this time he also started to develop many different colourful stage personas and build his stage appearances in-character according to those personas. Wearing provocative costumes and makeup, he and his projects swiftly came to the light of the media and he started gathering a cult following. His acting talent has also caught the attention of various film and stage directors, sparking his acting career. While he never got any notable lead roles, he was a very convincing actor nevertheless, and often appeared in an important supporting role or as a cameo. His most noteworthy performances in this field include Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre rendition9 of The Elephant Man, and Phillip Jeffries, an enigmatic FBI agent from David Lynch's movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Bowie has struggled with drugs in his young years, but eventually managed to get rid of his addiction. In his late years he was a major advocate of healthy lifestyle. He has also used his fame to send strong statements regarding equality and the need to stand up against racism. David Bowie died of liver cancer in his own apartment in New York City. It happened on January, 10, 2016, just two days after the worldwide premiere of his newest album, Blackstar. He's still remembered as being one of the most strange, wonderful and almost otherworldly10 artists of our age.A great strife1 engulfed the Kingdom of Scotland by the end of the 13th century. The benevolent and prosperous rulership of King Alexander III ended abruptly when he fell off the horse and broke his neck in an accident. He's left no heir, and his distant relative, a child queen Margaret, who was to succeed him in usual circumstances, has also died of mysterious illness. Thus began the period of Scottish history that later would earn a moniker2 of the Great Cause. More than 100 judges were appointed to oversee the contenders who were feuding for a vacant Scottish throne. One of the most promising claimants, John Balliol, has forged an alliance with a representative of English king Edward I, also known as Edward Longshanks. No man could foresee3 that this presumably clever idea would soon throw both nations into a 30-years long war. King Edward I has already sought to extend his dominion over Scotland for quite a long time. Him supporting John Balliol was but an attempt to turn Scotland into a vassal state that would help him wage a war with France. Not very surprisingly, King Edward was outraged when John, who by that time had won in the Great Cause and was himself a king, allowed the leading men of his kingdom to make a quick alliance with France and abandon any allegiance4 to King Edward whatsoever. An inevitable English invasion was soon to follow. As Scotland was losing one major battle after another, many Scottish nobles across the country were forced to swear fealty5 to Edward I. But for any such noble, an uprising would start elsewhere, and each such uprising would have its own leader to emerge. One of such leaders was a Scottish knight, sir William Wallace. Wallace had risen to prominence first when he led an attack on an English garrison in a small town of Lanark. Together with his men he managed to kill a sheriff who'd enforce English law, and escape with a woman, who, as contemporary sources seem to imply, was his wife and who's helped him to stage an attack. This was a very daring strike against English authority and soon enough many rebels across the country have sought Wallace and rallied under his banners. William has even managed to gain the blessing of Scottish church, thus, by medieval standards, gaining some degree6 of relative legitimacy. His most famous battle though was the one of the Stirling Bridge. Extremely outnumbered, under the leadership of Wallace the Scottish army has managed to hold and eventually route an elite cadre of English troops. The battle commenced on a small wooden bridge over the river Forth, which could let only three men or two horses cross it shoulder to shoulder. As English army was busy crossing, Wallace waited in ambush behind the hill overseeing the bridge. When there was no more room for a crossing army to retreat, but it was still not quite ready for a fight, Wallace and his men hailed7 upon unsuspecting invaders and massacred them. The bulk of English army that was still waiting to cross the bridge, seeing the events unfolding at the other side, decided to destroy the bridge and retreat. Subsequently it was scattered and many supply wagons were captured by Scottish army. What was thought to be a victory march for English turned into a humiliating defeat that left a large swath8 of territory in the hands of Scottish and encouraged the rebels to fight for many more years. William Wallace was captured by English knights on August 5, 1305. He was tried by English court, found guilty of high treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. But the First War of Scottish Independence was still fought by many other Scottish patriots throughout the land, and formally ended in 1328 with a treaty that confirmed Scottish independence, almost 25 years after his death.
