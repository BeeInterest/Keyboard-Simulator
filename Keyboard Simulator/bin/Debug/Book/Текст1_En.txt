Humans are generally good at noticing beautiful things. Humans are also generally good at building beautiful things. A Wonder of the World is a landmark1 or a natural phenomenon that is significant2 enough to be noticed by any person around the world. Many different lists of the Wonders of the World were made over the course of history, so let's have a look at some! The first of such lists was made by a Greek historian Herodotus. Only three places were mentioned in it. Eventually the list was expanded up to seven Wonders. Probably everyone can name at least some of those monuments: the Great Pyramid of Giza; the Hanging Gardens of Babylon; the Lighthouse of Alexandria; the Colossus of Rhodes; the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus; the Temple of Artemis; the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. The curious thing about these Wonders is that almost all of them represent3 the Greek culture. Another thing to note is that the ancient Greeks haven't actually used the term 'wonder', but instead it was a list 'of things to see', making such lists essentially4 just a travel guide. Almost all of these Wonders were destroyed one way or another, and today only the Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or the Pyramid of Khufu, still stands. This wasn't the only list of supposed Wonders though. Later on, many attempts were made (with a little to no consensus) to either make a new list or add more Wonders to the existing one. The most remarkable candidates were Colosseum of Rome, Hagia Sophia of Istanbul, Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China. Another peculiar5 attempt was made in 1994. The American Society of Civil Engineers made a list of Seven Wonders of Modern World, focusing mainly on an engineering scope of selected projects. Among other projects, this list features Panama Canal, Channel Tunnel and CN Tower of Toronto, which was the tallest structure in the world up to 2007. There is also a list of Natural Wonders of the World. It included the Great Barrier Reef, Mount Everest, the Grand Canyon of Arizona and, curiously enough, aurorae6, making it the first list of its kind to include a phenomenon instead of a place. But what about the world beyond Earth? Surely, it must have its wonders too! And indeed, in 1999, an attempt was made to list Seven Wonders of the Solar System. Amongst those were the rings of Saturn, the asteroid belt and the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Ultimately, the world is too big of a place to make an exhaustive list of all landmarks worth visiting. But those that didn't make into any prominent list are still protected and treasured by their neighbours. The organization that manages the lists of such landmarks and attends7 to any legal matters regarding them is called UNESCO. In the year 1066, after his victory at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror was seeking to strengthen his control over the subdued1 English territories. In the following 20 years in England nearly 40 castles were founded by him and his vassals. It was probably the largest castle-building operation in the whole history of medieval2 Europe. One of the castles was to be founded inside London, already the largest English town in those times. The so-called Tower of London was built on remains of an ancient Roman fortification, and initially was built mainly from timber. Only a hundred years later it was reinforced with stone. The castle takes its name from the White Tower, which is the name of the main keep that still stands as of today. People from other towns referred to it as The Tower of London, and eventually it became a name widespread3 enough to stick. Given its location and strategic importance, the castle soon became a residence for the richest and the most influential people across England. Over the years the castle has expanded greatly, because each of its owners was always seeking to add something distinct4 to its fortifications. One of the darker stories of that age is the tale of the Princes in the Tower, two young boys of royal blood who were declared illegitimate and then murdered by some unknown assailant5. Remains of two boys were found inside the castle in a wooden box in 1674. Starting in the 16th century, the castle started to see its use as a royal residence. It gained much notoriety6 in following years though, as it was also used as a prison and a place of execution for people who'd fall out of favour with their rulers. In modern times The Tower of London became less ominous7. At some point8 there was even a zoo inside. It started as a collection of royal pets that quickly outgrew its accommodations9 and was soon moved to the London Zoo located inside Regent's Park. It's still open nowadays and is a popular tourist landmark. Since 1988 The Tower of London has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage10 Site. In the 21st century it's mainly a tourist attraction. Usually you can visit the castle from Wednesday to Sunday, from 10 AM to 6 PM. The entrance fee for an adult is 25Â£. Visitors have free Wi-Fi access and can also buy some signature snacks in one of the cafes or kiosks inside. What is the largest organism living on Earth? How about those that are extinct1 now? These questions are trickier2 than they look. Are they about height, mass, volume or maybe length? Sometimes we can see only a small part of an otherwise huge living creature. Other times you can argue3 that a colony of organisms that behaves4 as one creature also needs to be considered5. Let's at least try to find out what are the largest creatures in some taxonomic kingdoms6 out there. We'll start with the animal kingdom. Of all the living animals the largest one (and also the heaviest one) is the majestic blue whale. It's so large that there are no scales8 available to weigh them as a whole. The heaviest blue whale ever recorded was at 190 tonnes, while the longest was about 33 meters long. It still came shorter than a humble lion's mane jellyfish that is nearly 37 meters long. The largest animal to walk on Earth today (or a terrestrial9 animal) is, without a doubt10, the African bush elephant. An adult elephant bull11 weighs almost 11 tons, and stands about 4 meters tall. Both the blue whale and the African elephant are very gentle12 giants. Despite this, sadly, both populations were hurt severely13 by humans. Currently both species14 are considered endangered15. But what about the extinct species? Everyone knows that some dinosaurs were gigantic! And while the dinosaurs aren't actually extinct (since modern birds belong to the dinosaur clade16 Theropoda), the largest of them we know about only from fossils17. For example, the famous Tyrannosaurus rex, as scientists speculate, was standing roughly 370 cm tall and was over 12 meters in length! The largest exhibited18 skull of T. rex was just about one and a half meters long. A study on Tyrannosaurus bones was made in 2012. It has revealed that T. rex had the strongest bite of any terrestrial animal, ever! A hungry Tyrannosaurus could bite with the force of more than 50.000 Newtons, which is comparable19 to some modern hydraulic press machines. One of the largest dinosaurs known today though is Giraffatitan. It was a large, plant-eating creature. Its mass could exceed20 70 tons and it was over 20 meters long! Other large extinct animals include the species called Palaeoloxodon and Paraceratherium. Those were the distant cousins of modern elephants and rhinos. They were the ones of the largest known mammals to walk the Earth, ever. But wait, animals are not the only living creatures out there! What about plants and other, more basic organisms? For example, an aspen21 grove called Pando located in south-central Utah, U.S., is believed to be a single organism connected by one root system. If this is correct, the size of Pando is 43.6 hectares, or 0.43 km2! It's at least a few thousand years of age, making it one of the oldest living organisms, too. And if you want to go wider, a fungus22 named Armillaria ostoyae occupies nearly 9 km2 as a single colony in the woods of Oregon, U.S. If you think about this colony as a single organism, it can be the largest organism in the world by area occupied. We're still making many discoveries23 today. And maybe tomorrow we'll find something that makes all these things small by comparison.
